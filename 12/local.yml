# Every github action needs at least one job.
# We could have multiple jobs, but for now I am only going to include one here.
jobs:
  build_and_test: # This is the name of our job, and you will see it in the 'Actions' tab.
    # We can have our integration tests run on multiple operating systems in 'containers'
    # that are hosted on github. You can create your own as well, or setup a 'container'
    # using a tool like docker if you like. For now, I am going to show you the ubuntu setup.
    # Available environments are here: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    # These are the steps that will be run every time that we run our script, one will follow
    # the other.
    # You can pretend you would be manually be typing these out in the terminal everytime you did
    # a 'push' before.

      # These next two steps need a little bit more explaining, because as we are finding out
      # testing graphics applications is really hard!
      # You learned this when you wrote your GUI applications tests earlier.
      # First and foremost, make sure your tests terminate at some point, otherwise they will run forever
      # and we will never finish this test!
      # Second, since we are running our code on github.com, we do not have a 'window', so we need
      # to install some tools that emulate having an actual desktop window to run our program in.
      # 'xvfb ' is one such tool, and you can see how I have set it up below.
